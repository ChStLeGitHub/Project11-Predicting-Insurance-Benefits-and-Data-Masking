# Predicting Insurance Benefits and Data Masking
 
**Objective:** To leverage linear regression analysis, the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, and linear algebra to assist Sure Tomorrow insurance company with customer segmentation, benefits prediction, and data privacy protection.

**Accomplishments:** I built a KNN-based classifier that can predict whether or not a person qualifies for insurance benefits with an F1 score of at least 0.90. I also built a linear regression model that predicts how many insurance benefits a customer qualifies for with a root mean square error (RMSE) of only 0.36. Lastly, I masked the data using linear algebra techniques and demonstrated that the linear regression worked just well after the masking.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Linear regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), linear algebra, data obfuscation, and mathematical proof
